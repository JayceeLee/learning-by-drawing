'''
Utilities for instrumenting a torch model.

retain_layers(model, layer_names) will add a model.retained dictionary
with an entry for each layer.  Each time the model is run, the retained
dictionary will keep a detached copy of each specified layer's output.

edit_layers(model, layer_names) will add model.ablation and model.replacement
properties with an entry for each layer.  When the model is run, the
output of the specified layers will be blended with the contents of
model.replacement, at a (convex combination) rate specified by model.ablation.
